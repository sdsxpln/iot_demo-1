     The purpose of the Progressive Letters Selection screen is to allow you to
add more letters to your typing "vocabulary" as your typing skills increase.
 
     As you become proficient in typing a set of letters you can specify the 
next set in the list.  The list is cumulative, that is, if you select the
letters in entry number 4 to learn, then all of the letters in the preceding
entries (1,2,3) will also be included in the drills.
 
     When you reach entry number 8, your drills will include all of the letters
of the alphabet, semi-colon, space bar, and enter key.
 
                      ** HOW TO STRIKE THE KEYS **
     Strike each key firmly and quickly with the appropriate finger, return 
it to its HOME position.  Keep the other fingers close to the HOME keys.
Strike the space bar sharply with the side of the right thumb.  The left
thumb is NEVER used during typing.
 
     The following HELP pages will briefly describe how to type the letters 
listed in this menu.

  1.  asdf jkl;  --  Place left-hand fingertips on the asdf keys and the right
      hand fingertips on the  jkl;  keys.  Close all fingers slightly and rest
      them lightly on the keys.  Slant the hands upward parallel to each other
      at the wrists and keep them low, just clearing the keyboard.  For the
      space bar, curve the right thumb and hold it slightly above the bar and
      pointing to the letter  b.

      i - K-finger (middle-right hand) up to the I-key.

  4.  g,h  -  These are easy. Reach over with the index finger keeping the
              wrists parallel and raised slightly above the keyboard. Keep
              the other fingers on their HOME positions.
      g - F-finger (index-left hand) over to the G-key.
      h - J-finger (index-right hand) over to the H-key.

                  ring or pinky fingers, strike the key sharply and return
                  to the home position. For w and o try to keep the pinky
                  on or very close to its HOME position.

  7.  c,v,n  - Reach down and strike the keys sharply then quickly return
               to the HOME position.  Keep the other fingers on or close to the
               HOME position; wrists parallel slightly raised above the key-
               board; elbows down to your sides and back straight.

      n - J-finger (index-right hand) down to the N-key.
 
  8.  z,x,b,m  -  These keys are difficult (that's why they're last). For z and
                  x keep the F and D-fingers on their HOME positions. When you
                  reach for the b-key keep the asdf-fingers on their HOME
                  positions.

  Enter Key - The enter key on the IBM-PC keyboard is a little difficult to
              to reach because of its unique placement.  With the pinky finger
              of the right hand reach way over to the right to press the enter
              key.
