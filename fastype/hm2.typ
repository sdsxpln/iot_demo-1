*** BEGINNER DRILLS     -     Menu 2 - HELP Facility                    Page  1
 
     The Beginner Drills selection menu is the place for you to start if you
are not familiar with the standard "QWERTY" style keyboard and wish to learn
the generally accepted methods of touch-typing using the HOME keys as a base.
 
     If you are already familiar with the keyboard but want to brush up on your
keyboarding skills, especially on the unique IBM-PC style keyboard, you may
find these beginner drills helpful.
 
     The methods used here for teaching you to touch-type in any of these
drills is RANDOM PROMPTING.  That is, FAS-TYPE will randomly select a char-
acter from the list displayed in the panel above the screen keyboard and prompt
you to type that key by changing the color of it.  When you have pressed the
correct key, the color will change back and another key is selected randomly.
This goes on until you have successfully typed the number of characters in-
dicated by the "Drill is XX Characters" message displayed in the text panel.
 
     Keystroke errors are indicated by a big red X overlaying the key that you
incorrectly pressed.  Meanwhile the key you are being prompted for will cont-
inue to flash and you will not be able to proceed until the correct letter
is typed.

          < F2 >  The HOME Keys
 
     The HOME Keys (asdf jkl;) are where the fingers of both hands are placed
when you start to type, and where each finger returns to after a different let-
ter is typed.  Pressing F2 will allow you to initially learn how to type the
letters of the HOME keys plus the space bar.  All previous drill or exercise
selections are reset.  You can also select just the HOME keys from the
Progressive Letters List  <F3>.

          < F3 >  Progressive Letters
 
     This function will display a list of letters that you can choose to learn
to type.  The numbered selection you choose will include all of the letters
in the previous entries of the list.  You should use this list to add
more letters to your typing skills.
     After you learn the HOME keys (Entry #1 in the list), the next letters
you should learn are  e, i, and the ENTER key.  Therefore you would select
entry #2 which then adds the letters e, i, and ENTER key to the list of HOME
key letters and the space bar.
