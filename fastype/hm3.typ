     Once you have become reasonably proficient at typing all of the letters of
the alphabet, you can try your hand at performing some of the simple exercises
selected from this menu.
 
     Your typing speed will be tracked during these exercises and printed on 
the text panel above the screen keyboard when an exercise is done.
 
     None of these exercises contain numbers or capital letters.  The only
keys you should know how to type besides the 26 letter keys, are the space bar,
the semi-colon (;), comma (,), dash (-), period (.), and the enter key.
 
     All of the keyboard aids are still available from menu 5 for your use.
An interesting combination may be to set the hidden key feature then outline
the HOME keys for guidance.

     Your task for any exercise selected from this menu is to type the line
 
that will be displayed in the text panel.  Follow the cursor as it points to
 
each character to be typed.  If you wait too long to type the character you
 
will be prompted by the key being flashed on the screen keyboard.  It will
 
continue to flash until the correct key is pressed.  Try to stay ahead of the
 
prompt so you can build up your speed.
