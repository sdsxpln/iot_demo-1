**** KEYBOARD AIDS ****     -     Menu 5 - HELP Facility                Page  1
 
     The purpose of the Keyboard Aids Menu is to let you select various screen
displayed keyboard options and turn them ON or OFF.
 
     The CAPITAL letter part of the "(OFF/on)" designation after each item ind-
icates the initial setting of the option when you first start FAS-TYPE.
 
     Each time you press a function key you will reverse the previous setting
of the option.  If it's ON you'll turn it OFF, if it was OFF you'll turn it ON.
 
     Each option keeps its setting through out all the drill and exercises
you may select.  They are not reset unless you change them, or reload
FAS-TYPE.  You can set as many options as you want to, but:
 
  ***   YOU CANNOT SET OPTIONS FROM THIS HELP FACILITY, YOU HAVE TO
