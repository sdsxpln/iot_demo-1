     The Progressive Numbers selection screen allows you to select the numbers
1 through 0 across the top row of the keyboard for typing practice.
 
     The list is cumulative just like the Progressive Letters list; when
you want to proceed to the set of numbers in entry #2 and you select them,
those numbers will be placed in the list along with the numbers from entry #1.
 
     When you reach entry #4, your drills will include all of the numbers from
1 to 0 across the top row of keys on the keyboard.
 
     When you become proficient in typing all letters of the alphabet listed
in the Progressive Letters list and all of the numbers in this list you may
then want to proceed to the exercises listed in the Advanced Menu (Menu 4).
 
     Press the SPACE bar to erase a wrong selection, then type in the correct
number for the set of numbers you want to learn.
     Selection #5 CANCELS previously selected number sets and removes them
from your drill set.
     The following HELP pages will briefly describe how to type the numbers
listed in each entry of the Progressive Numbers list.

  1.  4,5,6,7  -  These are the first numbers you should learn how to type.
                  Reach up to the top row of keys with the index finger of
                  each hand. Press the key quickly and return to the HOME
                  position. Bend the other fingers to compensate for the
                  extended reach and keep them on or very close to their 
                  HOME positions.  Keep the wrists parallel.
 
      4 - F-finger (index-left hand) up and towards the left to the 4-key.
      5 - F-finger (index-left hand) up to the 5-key.
      6 - J-finger (index-right hand) up and towards the left to the 6-key.
      7 - J-finger (index-right hand) up to the 7-key.

 
  2.  3,8  - These are the next number keys that you should learn. Reach
             up with the middle finger of each hand to the top row of keys.
             Remember to keep your elbows to your side, back straight, and
             wrists parallel. Keep the index finger of each hand on their
             HOME positions.
 
     3 - D-finger (middle-left hand) up and towards the left to the 3-key.
     8 - K-finger (middle-right hand) up to the 8-key.

  3.  2,9  -  These keys may be a little difficult because of the tendency
              to move the pinky along with the ring finger. Try to keep the
              index fingers on their respective HOME positions - f and j.
 
      2 - S-finger (ring-left hand) up and towards the left to the 2-key.
      9 - L-finger (ring-right hand) up to the 9-key.

 
  4.  1,0  -  These are the last number keys to learn. Reach up with the
              pinky finger to the number row key, press the key sharply then
              return to the HOME position. Keep the other fingers on their
              HOME positions. Distinguish between the zero key and the dash
              key. Distinguish between the lower-case l (sometimes used as
              the number 1) and the actual number 1 key on the top row.
 
      1 - A-finger (pinky-left hand) up to the 1-key.
      0 - ;-finger (pinky-right hand) up to the 0-key.

              "You will not learn much that counts if you do not
          have the urge to learn.  This is a thought you may well
          ponder.  You should strive to equip yourself with the 
          skills to excel in the job you have."
