     Selections from this menu require that you know how to type more than
just the alphabet.  The pre-defined drills selected will include Capital let-
ters, numbers, and special characters & symbols.
 
 
     The EASY Sentences selection (F2) contain mostly Capital and lower-case
letters.  You don't have to worry about numbers until you get to HARD
Sentences and Short Paragraphs (F3 & F4).
 
 
     The exercise format is identical to the pre-defined exercises selected
from the Beginner Exercises Menu (3); that is, you must type the character
pointed to by the cursor.  Keyboard aids from Menu 5 are still available to
you for assistance.
 
 
     When you select SHORT Paragraphs (F4) you will notice that the text panel
will display three (3) lines for you to type instead of two as in other ex-
ercises.  The length in characters of these exercises is about 120.

     You must SUCCESSFULLY type ALL of the characters displayed in the text
panel.  Keystroke errors (red X) will be flashed and the cursor will stay
positioned under the character that it is waiting for you to type.  It will
not advance until you have pressed the correct key.

or one long sentence.  Included are capital letters, numbers, symbols and
